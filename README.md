Work In Progress:

SayHi is a basic dapp designed to boost onchain interactions on various mainnet and testnet EVM networks.

To make the most out of this dapp, deploy your own version of the SayHi.sol contract and add your own unique signature.  Deploy this on as many chains as you like, then change the contract addresses for each network.  

The idea is thast deploying your own smart contract + interacting with it frequently should improve the quality of the wallet and it's on-chain footprint.

Deploying your own version of the smart contract is optional, and the dapp can be interacted with as-is to simply boost contract interactions on the various supported chains.

I will attempt to add as many new chains as I can while also improving UI and adding more gamification features.
